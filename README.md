Knights Travails
This is an assignment from The Odin Project:
A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board.
My task was to build a function `knightMoves` that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
